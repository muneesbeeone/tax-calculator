            <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm space-y-1">
              Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based indirect tax that has replaced many indirect taxes in India. It is levied on the supply of goods and services. The GST journey of a product or service from the manufacturer to the consumer involves multiple stages, and tax is paid at each stage, with the ability to claim credit for tax paid at the previous stage. This is known as the Input Tax Credit (ITC) mechanism.

              India has a dual GST structure, meaning that tax is administered by both the Central and State Governments.

                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Unified Market & Simpler Compliance:</strong> GST replaces multiple indirect taxes (VAT, Service Tax, Excise Duty). This creates a common national market and simplifies tax compliance, which is a major benefit for both new businesses starting out and existing businesses transitioning from complex legacy systems.</li>
                  <li><strong>Input Tax Credit (ITC):</strong> Businesses can claim credit for tax paid on inputs (raw materials, services). This prevents the &quot;tax on tax&quot; effect, reduces production costs, and improves cash flow.</li>
                  <li><strong>Ease of Doing Business:</strong> With a centralized online portal for registration, filing returns, and payments, starting and operating a business anywhere in India has become more straightforward.</li>
                  <li><strong>Improved Logistics & Efficiency:</strong> The removal of interstate checkpoints and the introduction of the e-way bill system have made the transportation of goods faster and more efficient, reducing transit times and costs.</li>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Transparent and Lower Prices:</strong> Hidden taxes are eliminated, and the benefits of ITC are often passed on to consumers, leading to more transparent and often lower final prices for many goods and services.</li>
                  <li><strong>Benefit for New Vehicle Buyers:</strong> GST has subsumed various taxes like excise duty, VAT, and cesses on automobiles. This has led to a more uniform on-road price across states and, in many cases, has reduced the overall tax burden, making cars and two-wheelers more affordable.</li>
                  <li><strong>Uniformity Across States:</strong> As a &quot;One Nation, One Tax&quot; system, GST ensures that the price of a product is largely the same across the country, eliminating wide price variations between states.</li>
